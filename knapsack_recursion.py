'''Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, 
we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit 
such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Each 
item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.'''
